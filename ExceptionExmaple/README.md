```ruby
try
{
    // Code to try goes here.
}
catch (SomeSpecificException ex)
{
    // Code to handle the exception goes here.
    // Only catch exceptions that you know how to handle.
    // Never catch base class System.Exception without
    // rethrowing it at the end of the catch block.
}
finally
{
    // Code to execute after the try (and possibly catch) blocks
    // goes here.
}
```
